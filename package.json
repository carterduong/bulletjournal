  "description": "I absolutely love bullet journals! While being a freelancer, it was the only way for me to keep track of parallel projects and tasks and to free my mind for personal stuff. I stopped working with bullet journals as soon as I started working full-time for [Kirby](https://getkirby.com) The chaos was a lot more controllable from there on. But I still miss taking notes and organizing tasks that way. Inspired by a [tweet](https://twitter.com/seaotta/status/1186382494582489088) I thought it would be a nice idea to come up with a very minimalist approach to a digital bullet journal.",
